    <h1>Sizzling Sisig</h1>
    <img src="../images/sizzling-sisig.jpg" alt="sizzling-sisig">

    <p>Cooking this <strong>Sizzling Sisig </strong>version requires you to first make lechon kawali. Now, you know where the crispiness comes from. I prepared the pork by boiling it for 1 hour. You can add bay leaves and other spices while boiling, it is up to you.</p>

    <p>The first thing to do is deep-fry the boiled pork until the skin turns golden brown and crispy. Use a deep fryer to make the process easier. A deep cooking pot with cover works too. The cooking duration varies. Check the pork every few minutes. Be extra careful during this step.</p>

    <h1>Ingridients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ lbs. pork belly </li>
        <li>½ cup Ladys Choice Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 pieces onion </li>
        <li>4 pieces Thai chili pepper</li>
        <li>2 pieces long green pepper</li>
        <li>16 grams Knorr SavorRich Pork</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup margarine</li>
        <li>2 cups cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep cooking pot or deep fryer. Fry the boiled pork belly until golden brown and crispy. Chop the crispy pork belly into small pieces. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat half of the margarine in a pan. Sauté half of the onions until soft. Add chopped pork. Saute for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add Knorr SavorRich. Stir and then add chili peppers and season with ground black pepper and soy sauce. Cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add Ladys Choice Mayonnaise. Stir and add remaining onion. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a metal plate (sizzling plate) on a stovetop. Melt remaining margarine. Transfer the crispy pork sisig into the metal plate. Let it stay for 30 seconds.</li>
